File Descriptions Help:
    Here you will want to list each type of file you wish to add to CAOM that you expect to 
    find in the HLSP directory you will be scanning.  Include the last portion of the 
    filename as well as the extension (i.e. _img.fits).  Then select appropriate Product 
    Type descriptions for each file listed.  The Required flag determines whether CAOM
    processing issues an error or warning if an expected file is not found.

Config File Help:
    This will assemble a YAML config file to use with hlsp_to_xml.py, which tries to 
    automate as much of the process as possible, but the user must provide certain 
    information.
    (relative filepaths should work in all cases)
    
    HLSP Data:
        Insert the file path to the HLSP data files you wish to scan.
        
    File Extensions Table:
        Insert the file path to the CSV file containing file descriptions for this HLSP.  
        You may have just created this file with the previous widget.
        
    Output File:
        This provides the file path and name for the hlsp_to_xml.py output XML file.  Name 
        this whatever you want.
        
    Overwrite:
        This will control overwriting an existing XML file.  On by default.
        
    Header Type:
        Indicate which type of FITS headers you expect to find with this HLSP.
        
    Data Type:
        This setting will determine the dataProductType parameter within CAOM product
        entries created for this HLSP, as well as other CAOM parameters, depending on
        which type is selected.
        
    HLSP-Unique Parameters:
        Define any parameters you would like to insert in CAOM that are not available in 
        the FITS headers of these HLSP files.  'Parent' defines which section of the XML 
        file to create the entry in.  'CAOM Keyword' will define how the parameter is 
        inserted into CAOM.  'Value' is the value you'd like to associate with this keyword.  
        A common entry is Parent="provenance", CAOM Keyword="reference", Value=
        "http://www...".  Parameters defined in this section will also overwrite existing
        parameters of the same CAOM keyword.
